<p> Paragraph 1
Kobe Bryant was an NBA player, who over 20 years, put together one of the greatest basketball careers of all time. Fueled by self motivation, hard work, and ultra competitivnes, Kobe Bryant was an amazing player, husband, and father. Unfortuantly however, he was taken from this world far to soon, as on January 26, 2020, his life, along with his daughter Gigi, was taken in a helipoter accident. It was a death that hurt and shocked the entire world, but through all that he did, Kobe Bryant still lives on. He lives on in every one of us, the fire that we have inside ourselves to keep going. 

<p> Paragraph 2
Kobe Bryants impact in basketball is impossible to measure, but even it dwindells in comparison to what he did as a man. Koby Bryant simply could do anything. Whatever it was he wanted or needed to do, he was going to work harder thatn everyone else around him to get there. It was the willingness to do whatever it took that made Kobe so special.
